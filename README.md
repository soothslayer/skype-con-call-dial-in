skype-con-call-dial-in
======================

Simple applescript to dial a conference call number as well as your number and then enter the conference code for you.

The script can be edited on your computer as an applescript file or as
an application file but it's easier to view on Github as applescript.
If you choose to download the applescript file you'll need to open it
up in Applescript and save it as an application file (hold down the alt
key when hovering over Save). Applescript files will not launch
automatically when attached to a calendar event. Only Application files
will).

After you save this applescript to your computer as an application (.app extension) I used the following instructions to run it when the conference call occurred on my calendar as a calendar event:
